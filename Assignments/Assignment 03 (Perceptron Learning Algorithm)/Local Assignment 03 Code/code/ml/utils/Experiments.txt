1. Accuracy of the models: 
    Accuracy of Perceptron Classifier: 74%
    Accuracy of Average Perceptron Classifier: 70.2%
    Accuracy of Deecision Tree: ~78%
    

2. Runtime Performance on 10 iterations:
    Average train time: 0.0073s
    Average test time: 6.0E-4s
    ------------------------
    Average Perceptron:
    Average train time: 0.0055s
    Average test time: 6.0E-4s
    -------------------------
    Decision Tree:
    Average train time: 0.0014s
    Average test time: 2.0E-4s

    Reflections: We believe that these numbers make sense. The reason behind this is because we know that the decision tree classifier has the advantage of being recursive. However, because of 
    the nature of the perceptron algorithm as it updates all of the features and the weighted vectors for them, then it makes sense to be a little slower (since we have to run a couple of 
    for loops to update these values). 
    
3. We decided to test on the accuracy of the algorithms when the number of iterations increases. We found that 
   if we set the numIterations to 20, Perceptron Classifier accuracy went down (70.2%) while Average Perceptron Classifier accuracy went up (76%). The accuracy for the 
   DecisionTree algorithm on a depth limit of 20 also decreased (58%).
